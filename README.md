- **Introduction:** A brief overview of the application/game, its purpose, and its target audience.

The game will be a local or online multiplayer game where players race through an obstacle course, fighting NPC minions to win. It is a simple game that will potentially use parody characters from popular shows (SpongeBob, Regular Show etc.) The purpose of the game is to be an enjoyable stress release for primarily children and teenagers (yet open to all ages), to play and have fun

I will also potentially add a 2v2 mode similar to the clash royale game mode

- **Value/Use:** A clear and explicit explanation of the value or use provided by the application/game.

The game is purely for enjoyment and etnertainment puposes. However, it will also encourage bringing people together as it is a multiplayer game so people can have friendly competition and compete to play the game and have fun!

- **User Interaction and Experience:** A description of how users will interact with the application/game and what their experience will be like.

Users will be able to select a character of their choice and then play a map. The map contains obstacles (blocks, lava etc.) and players will use the arrow keys or WASD to manuevcer their way through the course to reach the final destination while avoiding the NPCs. Beating the levels would earn the user XP and coins

buttons will direct the plaer to different pages on the games while also certsin pages may possess different content
ex. page for database info on top 10 players, page for instructions, potentially page for tutorial

- **Competitive Element:** Details on how the application/game facilitates competition among students.

The game will be competitive as there will be a leaderboard for the users with the most coins and XP for the top 20 users. Additionally, players will be able to compete locally or online to see who can beat levels quicker. Lastly, users are able to compete for bragging rights among their friends.

- **Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies:** An explanation of the features or strategies employed to make the application/game engaging and addictive.

The game will have paraodies of relatable characters to attract interest. Also it will have a bunch of colors and cool features (music, fanart etc.) to make it enjoyable. THe comeptitve aspect (both virtually and locally) also would icnrease the engagment and addictiveness as users would rapidly try to improve their skills at the game to get better. And the game's interface and gameplay will be fun as well!

- red

- **Scalability and Expansion:** A discussion of how the design allows for future growth and adoption beyond the initial homework assignment.

After discussing the components of the game with my peers, I can potentially take some of their ideas and incorporate them into my code, improving them.

- new features
- adding combat features
- various new characters/aaddition of a backstory

We could also potentially update the gae periodically (bimonthjly, monthly etc.) to add updates to the game while also fixing bugs and complaints.

- **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** A section detailing how the design adheres to the California non-discrimination clause and ensures inclusivity for all potential users.

Obviously there will be no racism or discrimination. Anyone has access to play the game.IF ta plyer has access to wifi they can play online but users can still play locally as well. Also, the characters will all be fictional and paradies of other fictional (non real) characters and not based off of real paper, preventing any legality issues and allowing anyone, regardless of background to play. If we decide to add lore/backstory to the chacacters, then we will make all the characters be as diverse as possible so everyone feels included.
